### Emergency Alert App

An app that will allow nurses, doctors, pediatrician and other healthcare practitioners to signup to an app where they will be alerted in case someone needs a medical assistance in nearby locations. This will be helpful most specially when ambulances are not accessible to remote areas.

### Risaykel (Recycle)

You want to recycle something. But you want a creative one. Like water bottles, magazines, In-cans soda etc. Risaykel is an app that will allow users to search or upload their creative recyclable items. Users who upload should write the instructions or upload videos on how to do the creative output. Example: Doing a mosaic from a magazine.

### Challenge Me!

An app that will contain preloaded sets of challenges or custom challenges where one can challenge a Social Friend. Example, playing a badminton, or solving a rubiks cube. In case they failed, they will donate a little amount to charity.

### LibreApp

An app that will allow professionals/skilled individuals to offer services for free. Example, a barber wants to offer a free haircut to 10 people. Service categories will be displayed to the app. Services like Article writing, drawing, song writing, plumbing are some examples. The app also has its portfolio for professionals/workers together with ratings and reviews. This is a way for them to showcase their talents by giving free services.

### Blood Donations

An app that will allow individuals to sign up and will be alerted if there are hospitals which needs blood donation or they run out of blood of specific types. This will be based on user's location

### Food Donations

How about an app that will let others know that one household is giving away a food. It seems awkward but it will be a good way for others to help to the needy. Or donate it to NGO to avoid food wastage

### Stray Pets Adoption

An app that will let others adopt a pet of yours or stray pets.

### Anonymous Advice

An app that will let users seek advice from anonymous professionals. Maybe legal, love or anything under the sun.

### Junk Shop (OLX-like)

An app that will let users upload their junks and will let the junk shops know that this user is selling junks in nearby locations.

### Pangasinan/PH FundMyEducation App

An app that will let people sponsor a child's education. One condition is that school should be transparent to pupils' GWA (General Weighted Average).
